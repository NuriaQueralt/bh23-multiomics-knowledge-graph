## Outcomes

### Biomedical knowledge graph

We have integrated the following data resources

- Uniprot
- mirDB
- MED-RT
- DisGeNet
- Rhea
- Drugbank (WIP)

to generate a biomedical knowledge graph

An updated [visual description of the Knowledge Graph](https://onodo.org/visualizations/242727) is [here](https://onodo.org/visualizations/242727)

The workflow and queries for constructing the knowledge graph is available here.

### Omics data
  - Biostudies mapping to knowledge graph
  - Multiomics data RDF representation definition

### Clinical knowledge graph

Clinical data for research is frequently modeled following the [OMOP Common Data Model](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html). The OMOP-CDM provides not only a data model but also a graph like structure of concepts and their relationships
  - OMOP SPARQL endpoint
    - Mapheator: https://github.com/oeg-upm/mapeathor
    - RLM/ShML: https://github.com/herminiogg/ShExML/
